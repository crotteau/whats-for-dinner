# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
Deciding what to cook for dinner is often a chore and this app provides recipe suggestions for those instances. The user can get suggestions for side dishes, main dishes, desserts, or entire meals. If the user wants to add their own recipe to possible suggestions, they can specify recipe type and the recipe name is added to that specific category. 

### Installation Instructions:
Installing this app is relatively simple. First open the 'whats-for-dinner' repository in GitHub. Click on the green 'code' button to clone the project onto your computer. Open up the project and html file to use the app!  (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

### Context:
I spent around 15 hours creating this project. The biggest hurdle for me was creating the right CSS elements to match the reference photo. It took some trouble shooting to figure out how to target the desired elements and how to correctly manipulate them. This was one of my first introductions to using CSS and HTML code, so it was a learning experience.

### Learning Goals:
The goals for this project were: 
-gain additional experience using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
-create a useful application that a user can interact with
-build an app layout using CSS and HTML that visually matches a comp 

### Wins + Challenges:
One win I had was getting the 'add recipe' feature to only add recipes if the 'recipe type' was one of the three pre-determined types and if the recipe name input field had been filled out. Another win was getting the page layout to match the comp. Specifically, figuring out what HTML element to target in order to change the desired elements. 

One challenge I had was turning the recipe type buttons blue when they're clicked and switching them back to their unclicked state when another recipe type is clicked. Currently, I have it so the button turns blue when it has focus, but ideally the button would stay blue after the let's cook button is clicked.
